# Suppose the true relationship between y and x variables can be 
# described as 
# y = 10+5*x1+5*x2-2*x3. 
# But, x3 is correlated with x1 with the relationship 
# x3=2-5*x1. In fact, you could've set the equation as 
# y = 6 + 15*x1 + 5*x2 [= 10+5*x1+5*x2-2(2-5*x1)] or 
# y = 12 +5*x2 -3*x3 = [=10+(2-x3) +5*x2 - 2*x3]
# See how vif can be used to detect the multicollinearity and 
# how the coefficients change when two indep. variables are correlated.

# Try the following and examine the coefficients

# collinearity_test(100,100,1)
# collinearity_test(100,10,1)

# Both the coefficient estimates and p-values are affected when there is a multicollinearity.
# If you drop one of the correlated variables, you will be able to estimate the coefficients
# accurately.

# It is, however, possible for you to estimate the coefficients accurately even when two
# variables are correlated. This happens when vif values are low. 
# Look at the following interesting example. 

# collinearity_test(1000,100,100)

# Due to high error variance (sd_x13=100) between x1 and x3, vif values are close to 1.
# As a result, you won't have problem in estimating the coefficients.
